      <h2>Vatican Roles</h2>
      <h3>Current Positions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Metropolitan Archbishop of Colombo (2009-present)</li>
        <li>President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Sri Lanka (2010-present)</li>

        <li>Member of the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments</li>
        <li>Member of the Dicastery for Evangelization</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Past Positions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of Sacraments (2005-2009)</li>
        <li>Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia and East Timor (2004-2005)</li>

        <li>President of the Pontifical Mission Societies (2001-2004)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Cardinal Ranjith has the relatively rare distinction of having served in the Roman Curia, in the diplomatic corps of the Holy See, and as a diocesan bishop. This combination of experiences has given him an unusually comprehensive understanding of the Church's governance at multiple levels.</p>
      
      <p>His five years as Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship under Pope Benedict XVI were particularly significant, as he worked closely with then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger on liturgical matters and was involved in the implementation of <em>Summorum Pontificum</em>, which expanded access to the pre-Vatican II Latin Mass.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Theological Profile</h2>
      <p>Cardinal Ranjith is generally regarded as a theological conservative with a particular focus on liturgical matters. His theological positions reflect both the influence of Pope Benedict XVI, with whom he worked closely, and his own experiences as a Church leader in Sri Lanka's complex religious landscape.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Theological Emphases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Liturgy:</strong> Strong advocate for reverence and tradition in liturgical celebration; supporter of aspects of the liturgical reform advocated by Benedict XVI</li>
        <li><strong>Evangelization:</strong> Emphasis on clear Catholic identity and witness in pluralistic contexts</li>
        <li><strong>Ecclesiology:</strong> Traditional understanding of episcopal authority and Church governance</li>
        <li><strong>Interreligious Dialogue:</strong> Commitment to respectful engagement with other religions while maintaining clear Catholic identity</li>
        <li><strong>Social Justice:</strong> Advocate for the poor and marginalized, particularly in Sri Lankan context of ethnic and religious tensions</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Liturgical Positions</h3>
      <p>Cardinal Ranjith has been particularly outspoken on liturgical matters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed permission for Communion in the hand in his Archdiocese of Colombo in 2011, requiring that it be received only on the tongue</li>
        <li>Advocated for priests to celebrate Mass <em>ad orientem</em> (facing east, with back to the congregation)</li>
        <li>Encouraged greater use of Latin and Gregorian chant in liturgical celebrations</li>
        <li>Critical of what he perceives as excessive creativity and informality in liturgical practice</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>While firmly committed to the teachings of the Second Vatican Council, he has advocated for what he sees as a "reform of the reform" that would recover certain traditional elements that he believes were lost in post-conciliar liturgical changes.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Global Experience</h2>
      <p>Cardinal Ranjith brings a wealth of international experience that spans multiple continents and contexts.</p>
      
      <h3>Diplomatic Service</h3>
      <p>As Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia and East Timor from 2004 to 2005, Cardinal Ranjith gained diplomatic experience in the world's most populous Muslim nation and in a newly independent Catholic-majority country emerging from conflict. This assignment required him to navigate complex political situations and to represent the Holy See in sensitive interreligious contexts.</p>
      
      <h3>Missionary Leadership</h3>
      <p>During his time as Adjunct Secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and President of the Pontifical Mission Societies (2001-2004), Cardinal Ranjith oversaw the Church's missionary activities worldwide. This role gave him a global perspective on the diverse challenges facing the Church in different cultural contexts and regions.</p>
      
      <h3>Crisis Leadership in Sri Lanka</h3>
      <p>Following the devastating Easter Sunday bombings of 2019, which targeted Catholic churches in Sri Lanka and killed 269 people, Cardinal Ranjith emerged as a prominent voice calling for justice, peace, and reconciliation. His response to this crisis, balancing calls for accountability with appeals against retribution, demonstrated his leadership in a deeply traumatized society.</p>
      
      <h3>Languages and Cultural Awareness</h3>
      <p>Cardinal Ranjith is exceptionally multilingual, fluent in Sinhala, Tamil, English, Italian, German, and French, with knowledge of Latin. This linguistic facility reflects his education and service in diverse contexts and enhances his ability to communicate across cultural boundaries.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Reputation and Influence</h2>
      <p>Cardinal Ranjith's reputation combines elements of traditional theological orientation with practical pastoral leadership and moral courage in challenging circumstances.</p>
      
      <h3>Papal Conclave Experience</h3>
      <p>Cardinal Ranjith participated in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis. While not considered among the leading contenders at that time, his profile has developed further in the intervening years through his leadership in Sri Lanka, particularly during the Easter bombing crisis.</p>
      
      <h3>Relationship with Recent Popes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With John Paul II:</strong> Appointed as auxiliary bishop and later as bishop of Ratnapura and to first Vatican position</li>
        <li><strong>With Benedict XVI:</strong> Close working relationship; appointed as Secretary of Divine Worship, later as Archbishop of Colombo, and created cardinal</li>
        <li><strong>With Francis:</strong> Respectful relationship, though representing a somewhat different theological and liturgical vision</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Leadership in Crisis</h3>
      <p>Cardinal Ranjith's stature grew significantly following his response to the 2019 Easter bombings. His calls for justice, including criticism of government failures in intelligence and security, displayed moral courage and independence. At the same time, his appeals for calm and against retaliatory violence against Muslims demonstrated statesmanlike qualities in a volatile situation.</p>
      
      <h3>Advocate for Religious Freedom</h3>
      <p>As leader of a religious minority in a predominantly Buddhist country, Cardinal Ranjith has been a consistent advocate for religious freedom and pluralism. His ability to maintain constructive relationships with Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim leaders while clearly articulating Catholic positions has earned him respect beyond Catholic circles.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Controversies and Criticisms</h2>
      <p>Cardinal Ranjith's positions and leadership style have occasionally generated controversy, though primarily in specific contexts rather than on a global scale:</p>
      
      <h3>Liturgical Directives</h3>
      <p>His decision to restrict Communion to reception on the tongue in the Archdiocese of Colombo and his advocacy for more traditional liturgical practices have generated some debate, with critics suggesting these moves represent a step backward from Vatican II reforms while supporters view them as necessary to restore sacred reverence.</p>
      
      <h3>Political Criticism</h3>
      <p>Cardinal Ranjith's increasing criticism of the Sri Lankan government following the Easter bombings, including calls for international investigation into potential government failures, has drawn sharp reactions from political figures. Some have accused him of exceeding his religious role and entering politics, while others see his stance as appropriate moral leadership in the face of institutional failures.</p>
      
      <h3>Management Style</h3>
      <p>Some observers have noted a certain directness in Cardinal Ranjith's administrative approach that can create tensions with those who prefer more consultative decision-making. However, supporters point to his clarity and decisiveness as valuable leadership qualities.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Papal Prospects</h2>
      <p>Cardinal Ranjith presents an interesting profile for the upcoming conclave, with several distinct strengths and challenges to his potential candidacy:</p>
      
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Global South Voice:</strong> As an Asian cardinal from a developing nation, represents the Church's growth beyond traditional European centers</li>
        <li><strong>Administrative Experience:</strong> Unusual breadth of experience across diocesan leadership, Vatican departments, and diplomatic service</li>
        <li><strong>Liturgical Knowledge:</strong> Extensive expertise in liturgical matters, important for preserving the Church's worship traditions</li>
        <li><strong>Linguistic Abilities:</strong> Exceptional multilingual skills that would serve a global leader well</li>
        <li><strong>Moderate Conservatism:</strong> Theological positions that might appeal to cardinals seeking a return to more traditional emphasis while avoiding extreme positions</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> At 77, somewhat advanced in age for a papal election, though not prohibitively so</li>
        <li><strong>Association with Benedict XVI:</strong> Close identification with Benedict XVI's liturgical vision might be seen as a step back from Francis's approach</li>
        <li><strong>Regional Considerations:</strong> Asia has never had a pope, representing a significant departure from tradition</li>
        <li><strong>Relative Profile:</strong> Despite his accomplishments, less globally known than some other candidates</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Cardinal Ranjith might appeal to cardinals seeking a candidate who combines traditional theological orientation with extensive Vatican experience and a global perspective. His candidacy would represent both continuity with aspects of pre-Francis papacies and recognition of the Church's increasingly Asian character.</p>
