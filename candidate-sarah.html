      <h2>Global Experience</h2>
      <p>Cardinal Sarah's global experience is uniquely shaped by his African heritage and his extensive service in both his native continent and the universal Church.</p>
      
      <h3>African Leadership</h3>
      <p>As Archbishop of Conakry from 1979 to 2001, Cardinal Sarah led the Church in Guinea during a tumultuous period of political instability and dictatorship. Under the Marxist regime of Sékou Touré, he courageously defended the Church's independence and the dignity of the Guinean people.

      <p>In his role as Secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (2001-2010), Cardinal Sarah oversaw the Church's missionary activities worldwide.

      <h3>Languages and Cultural Awareness</h3>
      <p>Cardinal Sarah is fluent in French (his primary language), Italian, and English, with knowledge of Latin. His upbringing in Guinea, education in Rome and Jerusalem, and extensive international travel have given him a cosmopolitan perspective rare among African prelates. At the same time, he often speaks of how his African heritage has shaped his understanding of faith, community, and the sacred.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Reputation and Influence</h2>
      <p>Cardinal Sarah is regarded as one of the most prominent conservative voices in the College of Cardinals, with significant influence among Catholics who value traditional expressions of faith and worship.</p>
      
      <h3>Papal Conclave Experience</h3>
      <p>Cardinal Sarah participated in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis. While not considered a frontrunner at that time, his profile within the Church has risen considerably since then through his leadership roles and publications.</p>
      
      <h3>Relationship with Recent Popes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With John Paul II:</strong> Appointed as the youngest bishop in the world by John Paul II, who recognized his potential early</li>
        <li><strong>With Benedict XVI:</strong> Strong intellectual and spiritual affinity; appointed to key Vatican posts by Benedict and collaborated on the book about priestly celibacy after Benedict's retirement</li>
        <li><strong>With Francis:</strong> More complex relationship marked by both collaboration and occasional tensions over liturgical and doctrinal matters</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Public Reception</h3>
      <p>Cardinal Sarah's directness and clarity in expressing traditional Catholic positions have made him a polarizing figure in some quarters. He is viewed with deep admiration by those who share his traditional outlook and with reservation by those who favor a more progressive approach. His speeches and writings regularly generate significant attention in Catholic media globally.</p>

      <h2>Controversies and Criticisms</h2>
      <p>Cardinal Sarah's tenure in Vatican leadership has not been without controversies, particularly during his time as Prefect of Divine Worship under Pope Francis:</p>
      
      <h3>Liturgical Directions</h3>
      <p>In 2016, Cardinal Sarah suggested that priests should return to celebrating Mass ad orientem (facing east, with their backs to the congregation). This statement, which some interpreted as contradicting Pope Francis's liturgical vision, prompted a clarification from the Vatican press office that no new liturgical directives had been issued.</p>
      
      <h3>Book Controversy</h3>
      <p>The 2020 book "From the Depths of Our Hearts," originally published with Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI listed as co-author, created controversy when Benedict's personal secretary requested that Benedict's name be removed as co-author, though his contribution remained in the text. The book, released amid discussions about allowing married priests in the Amazon region, was seen by some as an attempt to influence the Pope's decision on the matter.</p>
      
      <h3>Leadership Style</h3>
      <p>Some observers have noted tensions between Cardinal Sarah's directorate and other Vatican offices during his tenure as Prefect, suggesting occasional difficulties in collaborative governance within the Roman Curia.</p>
      
      <p>Despite these controversies, Cardinal Sarah has maintained his dignity and composure, consistently expressing loyalty to the Pope while also staying true to his convictions.</p>

      <h2>Papal Prospects</h2>
      <p>Cardinal Sarah is often mentioned as a potential candidate in the upcoming conclave, with several factors both supporting and challenging his candidacy:</p>
      
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Global South Perspective:</strong> As an African, represents the growing Church in the Global South</li>
        <li><strong>Doctrinal Clarity:</strong> Known for clear articulation of Catholic teaching at a time of cultural confusion</li>
        <li><strong>Spiritual Depth:</strong> Widely respected for his deep prayer life and personal holiness</li>
        <li><strong>Vatican Experience:</strong> Two decades of service in the Roman Curia across multiple dicasteries</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Courage:</strong> Demonstrated moral courage in facing persecution in Guinea</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> At 79, relatively advanced in age for a papal election</li>
        <li><strong>Polarizing Profile:</strong> Strong positions may make it difficult to build the broad consensus typically needed for election</li>
        <li><strong>Francis Era:</strong> Associated with positions that are sometimes seen as counter to the direction of the Francis pontificate</li>
        <li><strong>Management Experience:</strong> Less extensive experience in large diocesan administration compared to some candidates</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Cardinal Sarah's candidacy would likely appeal to cardinals seeking a return to more traditional expressions of Catholic teaching and worship, as well as those wishing to recognize the Church's growth in Africa. However, his election would represent a significant shift from the pastoral emphasis and style of Pope Francis.</p>
