      <p>Cardinal Bagnasco's global experience comes primarily through his leadership roles in European Church structures, rather than through diplomatic positions or extensive international assignments.</p>
      
      <h3>European Leadership</h3>
      <p>As President of the Council of the Bishops' Conferences of Europe (CCEE) from 2016 to 2021, Cardinal Bagnasco worked to coordinate the responses of Europe's Catholic bishops to continental challenges, including secularization, migration, and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

      <h2>Reputation and Influence</h2>
      <p>Cardinal Bagnasco's reputation within the Church has been shaped by his long tenure in leadership positions in Italy and Europe. He is respected for his administrative abilities and his articulate defense of Church teachings.</p>
      
      <h3>Papal Conclave Experience</h3>
      <p>Cardinal Bagnasco participated in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis and was considered a <em>papabile</em> (potential papal candidate) at that time, though not among the top-tier frontrunners.</p>
      
      <h3>Relationship with Recent Popes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With Benedict XVI:</strong> Strong relationship; appointed by Benedict as President of the Italian Episcopal Conference in 2007</li>
        <li><strong>With Francis:</strong> More complex relationship; Francis did not renew him for the Congregation for Bishops in 2013 during a broader reorganization</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Within the College of Cardinals</h3>
      <p>Bagnasco is respected among his fellow cardinals, particularly those of the European episcopate with whom he worked closely during his CCEE presidency. He bridges the John Paul II/Benedict XVI era with the Francis era, though he is more closely associated with the former.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Controversies and Criticisms</h2>
      <p>The most significant controversies surrounding Cardinal Bagnasco have centered on his statements regarding same-sex relationships:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>In 2007, his condemnation of same-sex unions reportedly led to death threats, resulting in police protection</li>
        <li>He drew criticism for comparing same-sex unions to incest and pedophilia in some public statements</li>
        <li>He criticized a Tuscan court ruling that recognized a gay marriage performed abroad</li>
        <li>He described gay civil unions and same-sex marriages as a "Trojan horse" that would weaken traditional family structures</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>In an unexpected move, he later cancelled public prayers of reparation that had been planned in response to a gay pride parade, though no explanation was given for this decision.</p>
      
      <p>At 82 years old, Cardinal Bagnasco's age would make him one of the oldest popes elected in modern times, which some view as a potential limitation given the demands of the papal office.</p>

      <h2>Papal Prospects</h2>
      <p>Cardinal Bagnasco's prospects in the upcoming conclave are shaped by several factors:</p>
      
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Extensive administrative experience at diocesan, national, and continental levels</li>
        <li>Respected for his clear articulation of Church teaching</li>
        <li>Bridges pre-Francis and Francis eras of Church leadership</li>
        <li>Experience in European Church leadership during challenging times</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> At 82, significantly older than the typical age for papal election</li>
        <li><strong>Health:</strong> Diagnosed with COVID-19 in 2021, though he recovered</li>
        <li><strong>Controversies:</strong> Some of his statements on social issues have drawn criticism</li>
        <li><strong>Association:</strong> Closely identified with the more conservative Benedict XVI era</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>While respected among his peers, Cardinal Bagnasco's advanced age may make him more likely to be an influential voice in the conclave than a serious candidate for election. However, in situations where cardinals seek a transitional figure with extensive experience, his candidacy could gain momentum.</p>
