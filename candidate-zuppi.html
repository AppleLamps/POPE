      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Matteo Maria Zuppi was born in Rome, Italy on October 11, 1955, the fifth of six siblings. His formative years coincided with the implementation of the Second Vatican Council, which would later influence his pastoral approach and ecclesial vision.</p>

At the age of 22, he entered the seminary in the suburbicarian diocese of Palestrina and subsequently completed his theological studies at the Pontifical Lateran University, obtaining a bachelor's degree in theology.</p>

      <h3>Strengths</h3>

        <li><strong>Diplomatic Experience:</strong> Proven track record in peace mediation and international diplomacy</li>
        <li><strong>Italian Factor:</strong> As an Italian with extensive Vatican experience, understands the Roman Curia and Italian context</li>
